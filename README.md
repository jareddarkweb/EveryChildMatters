# EveryChildMatters
A Repository for Creating firmware that can be put into Arduino microcontrollers and used to Map The remaining School sites of the Indian Residental Schools. The goal is to be finished all School sites in Canada and the USA by the Fall of 2022. This repository is a personal project of mine , and if you are reading this , can you share this with your friends and family so that we can give thousands of children a proper burial.  Any comment or feedback refer to the "Discussion Tab" of this repo.
